1980:"<p><strong>The Question:</strong> Are there any good examples of <a href=""http://reproducibleresearch.net/index.php/Main_Page"">reproducible research</a> using R that are freely available online?</p>

<p><strong>Ideal Example:</strong> 
Specifically, ideal examples would provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>The raw data (and ideally meta data explaining the data),</li>
<li>All R code including data import, processing, analyses, and output generation,</li>
<li>Sweave or some other approach for linking the final output to the final document,</li>
<li>All in a format that is easily downloadable and compilable on a reader's computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the example would be a journal article or a thesis where the emphasis is on an actual applied topic as opposed to a statistical teaching example.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons for interest:</strong>
I'm particularly interested in applied topics in journal articles and theses, because in these situations, several additional issues arise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Issues arise related to data cleaning and processing,</li>
<li>Issues arise related to managing metadata,</li>
<li>Journals and theses often have style guide expectations regarding the appearance and formatting of tables and figures,</li>
<li>Many journals and theses often have a wide range of analyses which raise issues regarding workflow (i.e., how to sequence analyses) and processing time (e.g., issues of caching analyses, etc.).</li>

2492:"<p>A former colleague once argued to me as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We usually apply normality tests to the results of processes that,
  under the null, generate random variables that are only
  <em>asymptotically</em> or <em>nearly</em> normal (with the 'asymptotically' part dependent on some quantity which we cannot make large); In the era of
  cheap memory, big data, and fast processors, normality tests should
  <em>always</em> reject the null of normal distribution for large (though not insanely large) samples. And so, perversely, normality tests should
  only be used for small samples, when they presumably have lower power
  and less control over type I rate.</p>

Julia takes advantage of a just-in-time compiler that gives it wicked fast run times and puts it on the same order of magnitude of speed as C/C++ (the same <em>order</em>, not equally fast). Furthermore, it uses the orthodox looping mechanisms that those of us who started programming on traditional languages are familiar with, instead of R's apply statements and vector operations.  </p>

<p>R is not going away by any means, even with such awesome timings from Julia. It has extensive support in industry, and numerous wonderful packages to do just about anything.    </p>

<p>My interests are Bayesian in nature, where vectorizing is often not possible. Certainly serial tasks must be done using loops and involve heavy computation at each iteration. R can be very slow at these serial looping tasks, and C/++ is not a walk in the park to write. Julia seems like a great alternative to writing in C/++, but it's in its infancy, and lacks a lot of the functionality I love about R. It would only make sense to learn Julia as a computational statistics workbench if it garners enough support from the statistics community and people start writing useful packages for it. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What features does Julia need to have in order to have the allure that made R the de facto language of statistics?</p></li>

I don't have a researcher/scientist background, I come from a computer science background with an emphasis on data analysis, I have a Master's degree and not a PhD.

<p>While I think it's good to have a PhD in that area, I don't think this is absolutely <em>necessary</em>.

41208:"<h3>The situation</h3>

<p>Some researchers would like to put you to sleep.  Depending on the secret toss of a fair coin, they will briefly awaken you either once (Heads) or twice (Tails).  After each waking, they will put you back to sleep with a drug that makes you forget that awakening.  When you are awakened, to what degree should <em>you</em> believe that the outcome of the coin toss was Heads?</p>

<p><em>(OK, maybe you donâ€™t want to be the subject of this experiment!  Suppose instead that Sleeping Beauty (SB) agrees to it (with the full approval of the Magic Kingdomâ€™s Institutional Review Board, of course).  Sheâ€™s about to go to sleep for one hundred years, so what are one or two more days, anyway?)</em></p>

<p><em>[Detail of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish"">Maxfield Parrish</a> illustration.]</em></p>

<h3>Are you a Halfer or a Thirder?</h3>

<p><strong>The Halfer position.</strong>  Simple! The coin is fair--and SB knows it--so she should believe there's a one-half chance of heads.</p>

<p><strong>The Thirder position.</strong> Were this experiment to be repeated many times, then the coin will be heads only one third of the time SB is awakened.  Her probability for heads will be one third.</p>

<h3>Thirders have a problem</h3>

<p>Most, but not all, people who have written about this are thirders.  But:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On Sunday evening, just before SB falls asleep, she must believe the chance of heads is one-half: thatâ€™s what it means to be a fair coin.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever SB awakens, <em>she has learned absolutely nothing she did not know Sunday night.</em>  What rational argument can she give, then, for stating that her belief in heads is now one-third and not one-half?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Some attempted explanations</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>SB would necessarily lose money if she were to bet on heads with any odds other than 1/3.  (Vineberg, <em>inter alios</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>One-half really is correct: just use the Everettian â€œmany-worldsâ€� interpretation of Quantum Mechanics!  (Lewis).</p></li>
<li><p>SB updates her belief based on self-perception of her â€œtemporal locationâ€� in the world.  (Elga, <em>i.a.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>SB is confused: â€œ[It] seems more plausible to say that her epistemic state upon waking up should not include a definite degree of belief in heads. â€¦ The real issue is how one deals with known, unavoidable, cognitive malfunction.â€�  [Arntzenius]</p></li>

<p>Assuming that is the case, my question is this: how the hell do I convince someone that is the case? </p>

140547:"<p>When I first started learning statistics, procedures like the t-test, ANOVA, chi-squared and linear regression each appeared to be very different creatures. But now I realise these procedures each do more or less the same thing. And likewise, values such as the variance, residuals, standard error and mean also measure more or less the same thing.</p>

<p>So I reckon all of these procedures and values, and indeed all of statistics, can be described in just one simple sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the expected value and what is the variation around this value?</p>

167051:"<p>As one becomes interested in statistics, the <a href=""https://youtu.be/BOWNHl3qOVA"">dichotomy ""Frequentist"" vs. ""Bayesian""</a> soon becomes commonplace (and who hasn't read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Signal_and_the_Noise"">Nate Silver's <em>The Signal and the Noise</em></a>, anyway?). In talks and introductory courses, the point of view is overwhelmingly frequentist (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood"">MLE</a>, $p$ values), but there tends to be a tiny fraction of time dedicated to admire Bayes formula and touch upon the idea of a <em>prior distribution</em>, usually tangentially. </p>

<p>The tone employed to discuss Bayesian statistics oscillates between respect for its conceptual underpinnings, and a hint of skepticism regarding the chasm between lofty objectives, and arbitrariness in the selection of the prior distribution, or eventual use of frequentist maths after all.</p>

<p>Sentences such as ""if you are a hard-core Bayesian..."" abound.</p>

<p>The question is, Who are the Bayesians today? Are they some select academic institutions where you know that if you go there you will become a Bayesian? If so, are they specially sought after? Are we referring to just a few respected statisticians and mathematicians, and if so who are they?</p>

<p>Do they even exist as such, these pure ""Bayesians""? Would they happily accept the label? Is it always a flattering distinction? Are they mathematicians with peculiar slides in meetings, deprived of any $p$ values and confidence intervals, easily spotted on the brochure?</p>

<p>How much of a <a href=""https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/is-bayesian-inference-a-religion/"">niche</a> is being a ""Bayesian""? Are we referring to a minority of statisticians?</p>

<p>Or is current Bayesian-ism equated with machine learning applications?</p>

<p>... Or even more likely, is Bayesian statistics not so much a branch of statistics, but rather an <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/"">epistemological</a> movement that transcends the ambit of probability calculations into a philosophy of science? In this regard, all scientists would be Bayesian at heart... but there would be no such thing as a pure Bayesian statistician impermeable to frequentist techniques (or contradictions).</p>

185507:"<p>Suppose we have data set $(X_i,Y_i$) with $n$ points.

194035:"<p><strong>Background</strong>: I do not have an formal training in Bayesian statistics (though I am very interested in learning more), but I know enough--I think--to get the gist of why many feel as though they are preferable to Frequentist statistics. Even the undergraduates in the introductory statistics (in social sciences) class I am teaching find the Bayesian approach appealing--""Why are we interested in calculating the probability of the data, given the null? Why can't we just quantify the probability of the null hypothesis? Or the alternative hypothesis? And I've also read <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/103625/when-are-bayesian-methods-preferable-to-frequentist"">threads</a> like <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41394/list-of-situations-where-a-bayesian-approach-is-simpler-more-practical-or-more?rq=1"">these</a>, which attest to the empirical benefits of Bayesian statistics as well. But then I came across this quote by Blasco (2001; emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the animal breeder is not interested in the philosophical problems associated with induction, but in tools to solve problems, both Bayesian and frequentist schools of inference are well established and it is not necessary to justify why one or the other school is preferred. Neither of them now has operational difficulties, with the exception of some complex cases...<strong>To choose one school or the other should be related to whether there are solutions in one school that the other does not offer</strong>, to how easily the problems are solved, and to how comfortable the scientist feels with the particular way of expression results. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Question</strong>: The Blasco quote seems to suggest that there might be times when a Frequentist approach is actually preferable to a Bayesian one. And so I am curious: <strong>when would a frequentist approach be preferable over a Bayesian approach?</strong> I'm interested in answers that tackle the question both <strong>conceptually</strong> (i.e., when is knowing the probability of the data conditioned on the null hypothesis especially useful?) and <strong>empirically</strong> (i.e., under what conditions do Frequentist methods excel vs. Bayesian?). </p>

<p>It would also be preferable if answers were conveyed as accessibly as possible--it would be nice to take some responses back to my class to share with my students (though I understand some level of technicality is required). </p>

<p>Finally, despite being a regular user of Frequentist statistics, I am actually open to the possibility that Bayesian just wins across the board.  </p>

195034:"<p>Having recently graduated from my PhD program in statistics, I had for the last couple of months began searching for work in the field of statistics. Almost every company I considered had a job posting with a job title of ""<strong>Data Scientist</strong>"". In fact, it felt like long gone were the days of seeing job titles of <strong>Statistical Scientist</strong> or <strong>Statistician</strong>. Had being a data scientist really replaced what being a statistician was or were the titles synonymous I wondered?</p>

<p>Well, most of the qualifications for the jobs felt like things that would qualify under the title of statistician.  Most jobs wanted a PhD in statistics ($\checkmark$), most required understanding experimental design ($\checkmark$), linear regression and anova ($\checkmark$), generalized linear models ($\checkmark$), and other multivariate methods such as PCA ($\checkmark$), as well as knowledge in a  statistical computing environment such as R or SAS ($\checkmark$). Sounds like a data scientist is really just a code name for statistician. </p>

<p>However, every interview I went to started with the question: ""So are you familiar with machine learning algorithms?""  More often than not, I found myself having to try and answer questions about big data, high performance computing, and topics on  neural networks, CART, support vector machines, boosting trees, unsupervised models, etc. Sure I convinced myself that these were all statistical questions at heart, but at the end of every interview I couldn't help but leave feeling like I knew less and less about what a data scientist is. </p>

<p>I am a statistician, but am I a data scientist? I work on scientific problems so I must be a scientist! And also I work with data, so I must be a data scientist! And according to Wikipedia, most academics would agree with me (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science</a>, etc. )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although use of the term ""data science"" has exploded in business
  environments, many academics and journalists see no distinction
  between data science and statistics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if I am going on all these job interviews for a data scientist position, why does it feel like they are never asking me statistical questions?  </p>

<p>Well after my last interview I did want any good scientist would do and I sought out data to solve this problem (hey, I am a data scientist after all). However, after many countless Google searches later, I ended up right where I started feeling as if I was once again grappling with the definition of what a data scientist was. I didn't know what a data scientist was exactly since there was so many definitions of it, (<a href=""http://blog.udacity.com/2014/11/data-science-job-skills.html"">http://blog.udacity.com/2014/11/data-science-job-skills.html</a>, <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/data-scientist/"">http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/data-scientist/</a>) but it seemed like everyone was telling me I wanted to be one: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/"">https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/</a></li>

<li>etc....the list goes on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well at the end of the day, what I figured out was ""what is a data scientist"" is a very hard question to answer. Heck, there were two entire months in Amstat where they devoted time to trying to answer this question: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/"">http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Well for now, I have to be a sexy statistician to be a data scientist but hopefully the cross validated community might be able to shed some light and help me understand what it means to be a data scientist.  Aren't all statisticians data scientists?</p>

204930:"<p>I'm completely blind and come from a programming background.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is to learn machine learning, and to do this, I first need to learn about linear regression. All the explanations on the Internet I am finding about this subject plot the data first. I'm looking for a practical explanation of linear regression that is not dependent on graphs and plots.</p>

<p>Here is my understanding of the aim of simple linear regression:</p>

<p>Simple linear regression is trying to find the formula that once you give <code>X</code> to it, would provide you with the closest estimation of <code>Y</code>.</p>

<p>So, as I understand it, what needs to be done is to compare the predictor (for example the area of a house in square feet) with the independent variable (the price). In my example, you probably can create a non-visual way of getting the best formula to calculate the price of a house from its area. For example, maybe you would get the area and price of 1000 houses in a neighborhood, and divide the price to the area? The result (at least in Iran which is where I live) would have a very negligible variance. So you'd probably get something like this:</p>

<p><code>
Price = 2333 Rials * Area of the house
</code></p>

<p>Of course, you would then need to go through all the 1000 houses in your data set, put the area in the formula above, compare the estimate with the real price, square the results (I guess to prevent variances from canceling each other out) and then get a number, then keep playing around with the <code>2333</code> to decrease the errors.</p>

<p>Of course, this is the brute force option where it will probably take ages to compute the errors and arrive at the best option, but you see what I'm saying? I didn't say anything about a graph, or a line, or points on a plot, or the best way of fitting a line to your existing data.</p>

<p>So, why would you need a scatter plot and linear algebra for this? Isn't there a non-visual way?</p>

<p>First, am I right in my assumptions? If not, I'd love to be corrected. Whether or not I am, though, is there a way to come up with the formula without playing around with linear algebra?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate it if I could get an example with the explanation, so that I can do it along with the text to test my understanding.</p>
